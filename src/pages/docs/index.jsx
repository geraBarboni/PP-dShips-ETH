            <p>
              In some parts of the world to receive a package of a purchase is
              necessary to give certain data to corroborate that one is the
              owner of the package, for example, imagine that we buy a 70-inch
              TV, and to receive it I need to give my full name, my id or dni,
              plus my home address which is explicit, and a package that is too
              obvious. Maybe I don't want to give so many details but still
              corroborate that I am the owner of the package. This is why dShips
              was created, a system with the idea of delivering local packages
              without revealing unnecessary information.

            <p>
              It serves as a tool for online stores that need to ship their
              products to buyers who choose to receive packages anonymously,
              guaranteeing their correct delivery. Generating anonymous jobs.

            <p className="font-bold text-2xl">How is this accomplished?</p>
            <p>
              By generating a ZK Proof that corroborates if the owner of the
              package is who he claims to be.
