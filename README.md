## Inspiration

In some parts of the world to receive a package of a purchase is necessary to give certain data to corroborate that one is the owner of the package, for example, imagine that we buy a 70-inch TV, and to receive it I need to give my full name, my id or dni, plus my home address which is explicit, and a package that is too obvious. Maybe I don't want to give so many details but still corroborate that I am the owner of the package. This is why dShips was created, a system with the idea of delivering local packages without revealing unnecessary information.

## What it does

It serves as a tool for online stores that need to ship their products to buyers who choose to receive packages anonymously, guaranteeing their correct delivery. Generating anonymous jobs.

##How is this accomplished?
By generating a ZK Proof that corroborates if the owner of the package is who he claims to be.

##Step by step

1. A purchase is made in a marketplace
   ![1]("C:\Users\gerar\OneDrive\Escritorio\1.png")
2. The product needs to be purchased, so the purchase becomes a package.
   ![2]("C:\Users\gerar\OneDrive\Escritorio\2.png")
3. A verified delivery person chooses which parcels to transport
   ![3]("C:\Users\gerar\OneDrive\Escritorio\3.png")
4. The delivery person goes to the store and picks up the package to be transported
   ![4]("C:\Users\gerar\OneDrive\Escritorio\4.png")
5. The delivery person goes to the buyer's address and verifies that he is the owner of the package to be delivered
   ![5]("C:\Users\gerar\OneDrive\Escritorio\5.png")

## How we built it

Actually as mentioned before, dShips is a proof of concept, conformed by a smart contract in solidity deployed in XXXXX and a front end developed in NextJs.

## Challenges we ran into

Understanding the users involved

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Beginning to shape a tool that will be able to provide jobs to people
Create a tool that facilitates the delivery of orders anonymously
Understanding and analyzing the tools available to bring this idea to fruition

## What we learned

Shape the idea
Knowing the Chainlink tools
Knowing Polygon tools
Focusing on a user problem and solving it with web3

## What's next for dShips

Shape dShips as an easy-to-integrate service for online stores to provide an anonymous product delivery option.
Integrate Polygon ID to validate delivery drivers and shoppers
Create a mobile dApp to facilitate the work of the delivery drivers
Devise an optimal system to prevent fraud by delivery drivers
